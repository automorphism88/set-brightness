# set-brightness
Shell script for setting screen brightness, intended for use with xbindkeys

Just edit the brightness_dir variable at the start of the script and run it as
a user that can write to ${brightness_dir}/brightness.

The script is intended to work with any POSIX shell but is tested and used by
the author with dash as /bin/sh.
